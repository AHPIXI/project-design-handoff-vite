## Design Handoff Project - UX Design Collaboration Project

This week, you will experience a design hand-off from a UX-design student and work on transforming that design into code. It is a landing page for a fitness club [‚ÄôGym‚Äù, ‚ÄúYoga Studio‚Äù] and you will build it in React. We want you to think about how you want to structure the site and what components to create. Your mission is to follow the designs thoroughly, but keep in mind that the designs are made from students that are, like you, learning a new profession. Interpret the design kindly.

This is a perfect opportunity to explore fun npm packages to create an image carousel or make some fun animations if that‚Äôs included in the design.

### Context:

This is a special week for all of us. It‚Äôs the first time we get the chance to collaborate with our UX design students ü§©¬†Everything will not run smoothly, but honestly - it doesn‚Äôt in a real work setting either. We will do this together üí™

- Details do matter. Assume that all design decisions are intentional.
- Be honest about any constraints. Try to implement the design, but if there's something that you feel you really can't do - speak up.
- Since you will not be able to actually build the project until you've seen the design, we've put together a list of the elements that the UX designers have gotten in _their_ project brief. If you want to get a head start before the design handoff, you could start by having a look at that and create some components:
  - A header section with a logotype and navigation
  - A main hero-section and the rest of the page with all information needed for the user to register and key value preposition
  - UX copy (no lorem ipsum this time)
  - A form for user input (to register/sign up for the class)
  - Form states (active, passive, filled, errors)
  - A footer with relevant information
  - Any other information or building blocks you want to add to your landing page

### Requirements:

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

### Your page should be responsive:

- Adapting to the different viewports

### Design

How you design your page is up to you, but take accessibility into account when you are styling your form elements - so inputs should have labels and should be easily readable and usable. We STRONGLY recommend having some kind of design or sketch before starting to code.

Feel free to use other survey tools such as Typeform, Google Forms as inspiration. Or you can check out Dribbble, Behance or Pinterest.
